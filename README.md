### Mastering Embedded System Diploma

This repository contains my journey and progress through the **Mastering Embedded System Diploma**. The diploma provides in-depth training in embedded systems, with hands-on projects and practical knowledge across various modules. It is structured into three terms covering the fundamentals, advanced topics, and industry-preparedness skills for a career in embedded systems.

**Diploma Outline:**

- **First Term Courses**: Foundational programming and architecture concepts, including:
  - C Programming (+40H)
  - Embedded C (+20H)
  - Data Structures (+6H)
  - Embedded Systems Architecting (+10H)
  - Introduction to Embedded System & Git-GitHub (3H)

- **Second Term Courses**: Core embedded systems modules focusing on microcontrollers:
  - Microcontrollers Fundamentals (+15H)
  - Microcontroller Peripherals (+20H)
  - Microcontroller Interfacing (+40H)
  - Software Engineering (Testing & Validation) (+9H)

- **Preparing for Interviews**: Guidance on embedded systems projects, interview preparation, and CV writing:
  - Technical Exam
  - Embedded System Project based on Term 1 & 2
  - Mock Interviews with industry experts
  - CV Writing

- **Third Term Courses**: Advanced industry-oriented topics for real-world applications:
  - Introduction to Adaptive AUTOSAR (3H)
  - ROS Robot Programming (2H)
  - Automotive Ethernet Protocol (2H)
  - Session Chiplet, UCIe, and PCIe
  - Mastering CAN Protocol (+15H)
  - Mastering ARM Instruction Set Cortex-M3/4 (+15H)
  - Creating an RTOS Scheduler
  - FreeRTOS (+10H)

This repository will be a comprehensive record of notes, code samples, project files, and resources from each module as I progress through the diploma.
